    <p> I currently work as a Product Owner for the residential energy storage fleet, with the mission to improve our product and scale our product to hundreds of thousands of homes. Previously, I was an Energy Analyst at Tesla, where I worked to improve the performance of our residential solar fleet. Having realized how software/tech is eating the world,
    practically disrupting every industry out there, I've learnt that there was no way around besides understanding this better if I wished to build things that could impact millions if not
    billions of people; and that is what has gotten me back to try and self-learn the language of machines.This product is the inception of that journey, as I work towards becoming comfortable being uncomfortable with data. 

  <p>Curiosity drives me, and I'm particularly excited by the advancements in AI and energy field, and wish to make a lasting contribution towards an optimistic, long-term future.</p>
