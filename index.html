        <p>My *short* journey so far summed up on <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshaych98/' target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>
        <p>I continuously try to dabble with code, like you can see on <a href='https://github.com/akshayvkt' target="_blank">GitHub</a>. 
          Currently learning the <a href = 'https://course.fast.ai/' target="_blank">fast.ai</a>course</p>
        <p>You can also find me occasionally tweet on the <a href='https://twitter.com/ch_venkatakshay' target="_blank">bird app</a></p>
        <p>Curiosity drives me. AI and clean energy are two things that live rent-free in my head, and I hope to make lasting contributions towards a future that's both exciting and sustainable.</p>

        <p> Was very excited about courses in different departments (except my own major). Ended up doing 40 credits 
          in two semesters with a GPA that I was surprised by</p>
        <p>Majored in Chemical Engineering. Ironically, interning at O&G companies drew me towards renewables</p>
