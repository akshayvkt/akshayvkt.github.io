        <p>This is a work in progress, and I aim to setup daily goals to work and make this better.</p>
        <p> I'm an Energy Analyst at Tesla, where I work to improve the performance of our large residential solar fleet. Having realized how software/tech is eating the world,
          practically disrupting every industry out there, I've learnt that there was no way around besides understanding this better if I wished to build things that could impact millions if not
          billions of people; and that is what has gotten me back to try and self-learn the language of machines. This product is the inception of that journey, as I work towards becoming comfortable being uncomfortable with data. Previously,
          I pursued my Master's at Cornell University, where I specialized in Energy Economics & Engineering. Before that, I completed my bachelor's at Osmania University in India, where I majored in chemical
          engineering.

        <h3>Master's in Chemical Engineering - Energy Economics & Engineering Specialization</h3>
        <p>Aug 2019 - Aug 2020</p>
        <p>GPA: 4.0</p>
        <p>Explored my interest in the field of renewables, consulting and analytics.
          Ended up doing close to 40 credits in 2 semesters</p>

        <h3>Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering</h3>
        <p>Aug 2015 - June 2019</p>
        <p>GPA: 8/10</p>
        <p>Interned at two of India's largest oil & gas companies - being there helped me realize first-hand the scale of damage being caused by fossil fuels 
          and renewed<em>(pun intended)</em> an interest in clean energy. Was not certain about a lot of things,
          except for knowing for certain that it was not being a chemical engineer.
