        <p>This is a work in progress, and I aim to setup daily goals to work and make this better.</p>
        <p> I currently work as a Product Owner for the residential energy storage fleet, with the mission to improve our product and scale our product to hundreds of thousands of homes. Previously, I was an Energy Analyst at Tesla, where I worked to improve the performance of our residential solar fleet. Having realized how software/tech is eating the world,
          practically disrupting every industry out there, I've learnt that there was no way around besides understanding this better if I wished to build things that could impact millions if not
          billions of people; and that is what has gotten me back to try and self-learn the language of machines.This product is the inception of that journey, as I work towards becoming comfortable being uncomfortable with data. 

        <p>Curiosity drives me, and I'm particularly excited by the advancements in AI and energy field, and wish to make a lasting contribution towards an optimistic, long-term future.</p>
          <!-- Previously,I pursued my Master's at Cornell University, where I specialized in Energy Economics & Engineering. Before that, I completed my bachelor's at Osmania University in India, where I majored in chemical
          engineering. -->

        <p>Aug 2019 - Aug 2020</p>
        <p>Tried to learn all I could get into, ended up doing 40 credits

        <h3>Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering</h3>
        <p>Aug 2015 - June 2019</p>
        <p>Interned at two of India's largest oil & gas companies - being there helped me realize first-hand the scale of damage being caused by fossil fuels 
          and renewed<em>(pun intended)</em> an interest in clean energy. Was not certain about what I was going to do in the future,
          except for knowing for certain that it was not being a chemical engineer.
