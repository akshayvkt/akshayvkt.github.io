        <p>My professional journey summed up at <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshaych98/' target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>
        <p>I sometimes try to dabble with code on <a href='https://github.com/akshayvkt' target="_blank">GitHub</a></p>
        <p>You can also find me tweet occasionally on the <a href='https://twitter.com/ch_venkatakshay' target="_blank">bird app</a></p>

        <!-- <p>This is a work in progress, and I aim to setup daily goals to work and make this better.</p> -->
        <!-- <p> I currently work as a Product Owner with the mission to scale our energy storage product to hundreds of thousands of homes.  -->
        <!-- Previously, I was an Energy Analyst at Tesla, where I worked to improve the performance of our residential solar fleet. Having realized how software/tech is eating the world,
          practically disrupting every industry out there, I've learnt that there was no way around besides understanding this better if I aim to build things that could impact millions if not
          billions of people; and this is what drives me. This page is my forcing functions, as I work towards becoming comfortable being uncomfortable. -->
        <p>Curiosity drives me, and I'm particularly excited by the advancements in AI and energy field, and wish to make a lasting contribution towards an optimistic, long-term future.</p>
          <!-- Previously,I pursued my Master's at Cornell University, where I specialized in Energy Economics & Engineering. Before that, I completed my bachelor's at Osmania University in India, where I majored in chemical
          engineering. -->

        <!-- <p>Interned at two of India's largest oil & gas companies - being there helped me realize first-hand the scale of damage being caused by fossil fuels 
          and renewed<em>(pun intended)</em> an interest in clean energy. Was not certain about what I was going to do in the future, -->
        <p>Majored in Chemical Engineering. Ironically, interning at O&G companies got me excited about renewables</p>
          <!-- except for knowing for certain that it was not being a chemical engineer.  -->
