        <p><a href ='https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/' target="blank">Borrowed inspiration</a></p>
        <p>My *short* journey so far summed up at <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshaych98/' target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>
        <p>I continuously try to dabble with code, like you can see on <a href='https://github.com/akshayvkt' target="_blank">GitHub</a>. 
          Currently learning the <a href = https://course.fast.ai/>fast.ai</a>course</p>
        <p>You can also find me occasionally tweet on the <a href='https://twitter.com/ch_venkatakshay' target="_blank">bird app</a></p>

        <!-- <p>This is a work in progress, and I aim to setup daily goals to work and make this better.</p> -->
        <!-- <p> I currently work as a Product Owner with the mission to scale our energy storage product to hundreds of thousands of homes.  -->
        <!-- Previously, I was an Energy Analyst at Tesla, where I worked to improve the performance of our residential solar fleet. Having realized how software/tech is eating the world,
          practically disrupting every industry out there, I've learnt that there was no way around besides understanding this better if I aim to build things that could impact millions if not
          billions of people; and this is what drives me. This page is my forcing functions, as I work towards becoming comfortable being uncomfortable. -->
        <p>Curiosity drives me. AI and clean energy are two things that live rent-free in my head, and I hope to make lasting contributions towards a future that's both exciting and sustainable.</p>
          <!-- Previously,I pursued my Master's at Cornell University, where I specialized in Energy Economics & Engineering. Before that, I completed my bachelor's at Osmania University in India, where I majored in chemical
          engineering. -->
