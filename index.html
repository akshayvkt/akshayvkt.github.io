        <p>This is a work in progress, and I aim to setup daily goals to work and make this better.</p>
        <p> I'm an Energy Analyst at Tesla, where I work to improve the performance of our large residential solar fleet. Having realized how software/tech is eating the world,
          practically disrupting every industry out there, I've learnt that there was no way around besides understanding this better if I wished to build things that could impact millions if not
          billions of people; and that is what has gotten me back to try and self-learn the language of machines. This product is the inception of that journey, as I work towards becoming comfortable being uncomfortable with data. Previously,
          I pursued my Master's at Cornell University, where I specialized in Energy Economics & Engineering. Before that, I completed my bachelor's at Osmania University in India, where I majored in chemical
          engineering.

          <h3> Steps to be taken </h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Figure out what content to have on the page i.e., html stuff</li>
              <li>Organize the content (with links of different sites), keep it simple </li>
              <li> Do the CSS formatting </li>
              <li> If possible, throw in JS onto the site too, use eventListeners and things like that</li>
